Welcome sections not appearing on first scrolldown in Welcome.js

Font management

Current view (plus modal open/close logic) should set sidebar buttons in selected state

Icons for GetStarted modal

Establish fixed dark mode color palette

Redo all modals and visual components according to same style


GPTteacher - text to speech and speech to text
    Add stream to live
    add pause/stop audio button.
    voice to text?
    Later add same for the Assistatn + optional voice input


Course Selection component
    Course selection submit notification should be displayed in app UI instead of popup
        Or simply return to Curriculum view?
    Add STX + HTX courses
    Some sort of visual identifier for HHX, STX, and HTX courses as some users will likely want to combine course across educations.
        Courses should likely not share groups across studies even if almost identical (math A hhx vs math A stx, for instance)
            therfore, a need for visual identification in the coursebox (not the course name)


VariableContent
    isReady only after having clicked the button. Therefore not when only initialmessage is displayed. If easy to implement that is


Error on user version Selection


GPTassistant
    Give context on site and functionality


Filter for course boxes (alphabetical, progress, mastery, etc.)


Courses
    Progress should be a variable that depends on number of thread messages to start with (later a algo where the GPT evaluates teached content in relation to total syllabus)
        Add database progression implementations for course threads
        GPT to evaluate progress using listed messages as a start?
        Mastery will be separate and depend on exercise answers from user
    Add Exercise component to courses
        later implement mastery as variable


Settings
    implement functionality to lock features behind paywall
        grey out locked content, price on hover
    add currency implementation into app
        show currency in header for users that are logged in
        Set price for items in settings, shown on hover.
    ai personality settings
    delete account option?
    changing app color palette


Visuals/design/styling
    redo sidetab
        design
        animations on tabs, and currently selected color for tabs
    Customizable color palette
        In settings make posssible to change color palette
        implement site-wide
        default light and dark mode + multiple premium palettes
    Redesign Welcome.js component
        design overhaul
        User signup modal init when clicking bottom box in Welcome.js comp
    How it works page tab (permanent)
        full list of features and descriptions
        detailed comparison between user models
        pricing
    Curriculum design
        more visuals for progress, mastery, etc.

    SelectCourses
        Make SelectCourses look like a weekly school schedule for pure aestitic purposes
        Do something practical, but also creative, for Curriculum too


Fix:
    LegacyAPIWarning: The Query.get() method is considered legacy as of the 1.x series of SQLAlchemy and becomes a legacy construct in 2.0. The method is now available as Session.get() (deprecated since: 2.0) (Background on SQLAlchemy 2.0 at: https://sqlalche.me/e/b8d9)
    Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: http://localhost:3000/logo.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
    log ind modals (an others) should appear on top layer. For instance, when GetStarted is open and clicking on log in, the login modal appears behind the GetStarted component


GPT assistant exercises
    Implement exercises. Should be generated and displayed at a certain interval and/or by user request?
    Can it somehow make use of custom functions for the GPT assistant api?


Since GPT assistant generation is slow, consider adding:
    automatic start of next message (which user can pause, and/or adjust the speed of)
    this however, will then not allow the user to specify the direction of the conversation using buttons/inputs?? Think about way to solve for this
    Best approach is likely to start new GPT msg generation immedieatly on both fetchinitialmsg and after each "continue" submission.
        This msg should then be put in queue and be displayed when the button is actually pressed if ready, or wait ontil completion and then displayed
        If other submission than continue from user, then delete qeued msg or stop current msg generation, and start generating new msg based on user input


AI assistant basic functionality
    redo language logic
    improve/add default context
    personality settings?
    enable/disable avatar voice: if enabled, AI output (not default msg) will output audio
    audio input from user ??
    use current screen print as context ??
    Vastly reduce available use with rate limit for users that are not logged in (only the basic ai assistant is available in this state)


Profile sidebar tab?
    for setting profile configuration. STX/HHX/HTX, learning style, etc.
    *for dev purposes
    *but later used as the intro questionnaire. Then keep it as page so user can always configure
    Think more about how to use or if to use this tab component


Email verification.
    Standard link to verify.


Studieretningsproject
    Unlock SOP course (for HHX) with a certain overall progress/mastery (or specific course progress)


Padding/margin below error msg in GetStarted


Fix: quickly shows Welcome.js component on refresh (likely while it ways for token verification to complete)
