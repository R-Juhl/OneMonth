AI assistant basic functionality
- make UI look good, scrool for entire history (with some cap?)
- improve/add default context
- enable/disable avatar voice: if enabled, AI output (not default msg) will output audio
- audio input from user ??
- use current screen print as context ??

Sidebar:
- fix issue where it does not move when scrolling
    * should move up the height of the header until the header disappears, then it can be locked

Settings sidebar tab
- use modals for pages?
- how to structure pages? individual components? how to display them?
- For settings:
    include AI avatar selection
    ai personality settings
    language selection (that will be implemented at later stage)
    delete account option?
    changing app color palette
    (some of these settings are just for dev and will be paid options in the app)

Signup/login modals
- make it so error messages are not shared, and also clear when closing modal


Profile sidebar tab
- for setting profile configuration. STX/HHX/HTX, learning style, etc.
    *for dev purposes
    *but later used as the intro questionnaire. Then keep it as page so user can always configure
