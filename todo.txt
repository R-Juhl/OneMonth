Language support:
    Implement centralized language setting on entire site



For settings:
    ai personality settings
    implement actual language change functionality
    delete account option?
    changing app color palette
    (some of these settings are just for dev and will be paid options in the app)
    Lock mechanic and visualization on options (palettes, avatars, etc.)


AI assistant basic functionality
    improve/add default context
    personality settings?
    enable/disable avatar voice: if enabled, AI output (not default msg) will output audio
    audio input from user ??
    use current screen print as context ??
    Vastly reduce available use with rate limit for users that are not logged in (only the basic ai assistant is available in this state)


Signup/login modals
    make it so error messages are not shared, and also clear when closing modal

Profile sidebar tab
    for setting profile configuration. STX/HHX/HTX, learning style, etc.
    *for dev purposes
    *but later used as the intro questionnaire. Then keep it as page so user can always configure


Curriculum sidebar tab (main hub for study plan)


Email verification.
    Standard link to verify.

Get Started page tab
    Will be (only) available conditional page tab when user not logged in.
    When clicked, option to sign in or create user - effectively forcing user signups for app use
    Next, upon first login to verified user, give 3 options for getting started: Free, Mentor, Unlimited, Custom (upload own studyplan(s) doc and app will work with this)
        With short descriptions for each, and nice visual with icons
        Choosing one will add a version id to the database for the specific user id
        Option to upgrade version later
        All free for dev
    After selecting a user version, initialize app based on the specified version with relevant page tabs, etc.


Do not verify token for opening page tabs and all other random clicks (for instance clicks in Settings.js modal)
